        <h1>Instant pot Crawfish boil</h1>
        <img src="../Pictures/crawfishimage.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> It takes 30 minutes to get the stockpot full of water to come to a boil and then the crawfish require 30 minutes of soaking, which results in overcooked potatoes and corn. This year I was determined to simplify the process and set out looking for an Instant Pot® method online. There were plenty of recipes that called for frozen crawfish but I couldn't find one single one that used live crawfish. Challenge accepted! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons concentrated liquid shrimp and crab boil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seafood seasoning</li>
        <li>2 pounds live crawfish, rinsed </li>
        <li>1 pound bite-sized red potatoes </li>
        <li>3 ears corn, shucked and cut into thirds, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package andouille sausage, sliced </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cups water </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, dry crab boil, and seafood seasoning in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add live crawfish. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 0 (zero) minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build (as the pressure builds it will steam the crawfish.)</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour crawfish and the liquid into a large bowl and let sit for 30 minutes to soak while you prepare the rest of the meal.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes, corn, andouille sausage, and 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning to the pot. Pour in water and stir until evenly combined. Close and lock the lid.
            </li>
            <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture between 4 plates and serve with crawfish.</li>
        </ol>
